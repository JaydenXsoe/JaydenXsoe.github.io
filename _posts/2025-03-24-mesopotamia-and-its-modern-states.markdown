When initially starting to learning about `Cryptocurrency` on [Brilliant.org][brilliant-org], I was greeted with this lesson opener text:
>"A Brief History of Currency
>
>A sad reality of life is that, in all likelihood, you don’t have all the things you want. What's worse, other people have them."

This goes on to further explain that the remedy humans have devised was the bartering system. Which is a system built on trading goods and/or services.

Me remembering very little about this topic from school, I decided to research the origins, which reaches as far back as 6000BCE Mesopotamia, currently modern-day Iraq, and parts of Iran, Syria, Turkey, and Kuwait.

As I am intrigued by many of the little details of these meta, I search up the original meaning of `Mesopotamia`, translated from Greek to mean "the land between the rivers".

Further more an exec of `ollama run gemma3` the [new shiny google open source AI model][gemma-3] as of `march 12, 2025`, yields results on this ancient land being known as the `Fertile Crescent` which sits in:
> a region blessed with incredibly rich agricultural land. This attracted civilizations – Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, etc. – all vying for control of this wealth.

'I wonder' after all these years how could a `Fertile Crescent` end up as it is today, being some what aware of the current state of affairs with the aforementioned countries:
>"""You've hit on a truly complex and fascinating question. The persistent instability and conflict in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, parts of Syria and Turkey) isn't a simple story. It’s a tangled web of ancient history, resource competition, geopolitical maneuvering, and the unintended consequences of 20th-century interventions. Let's break down the key factors:
>
>**1. Ancient Roots of Instability:**
>
>* **Fertile Crescent & Resources:** Mesopotamia sits in the “Fertile Crescent,” a region blessed with incredibly rich agricultural land. This attracted civilizations – Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, etc. – all vying for control of this wealth. The land was a prize.
>
>* **Strategic Location:** Its location at the crossroads of trade routes between Europe, Asia, and Africa 
>made it a crucial hub for commerce and military power. Control of these routes meant control of wealth and 
>influence.
>
>* **Constant Warfare:**  The competition for resources, trade routes, and dominance led to almost constant 
>warfare. City-states rose and fell, empires expanded and contracted, all fueled by the desire for power and 
>control. The Assyrian Empire, in particular, was renowned for its brutal military campaigns.
>
>* **Complex Religious & Political Systems:** The rise of complex religious systems (polytheism, ziggurats, priesthoods) often intertwined with political power, creating further divisions and conflicts.
>
>**2. 20th & 21st Century Geopolitics – The Seeds of Modern Conflict:**
>
>* **The Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916):** This secret agreement between Britain and France, drawn up during 
>World War I, carved up the Ottoman Empire (which controlled Mesopotamia) into spheres of influence. This 
>fundamentally ignored the existing ethnic and religious diversity of the region, setting the stage for 
>future problems.
>
>* **The British Mandate (1920-1932 & 1941-1951):** Britain ruled Iraq as a mandate of the League of Nations. 
>They deliberately created artificial borders, uniting disparate groups (Kurds, Arabs, Assyrians) under Iraqi 
>rule, largely ignoring their own desires for autonomy. This created deep-seated grievances.
>
>* **Post-World War II & the Rise of Ba'athism:** After WWII, Britain withdrew. The Iraqi monarchy was 
>overthrown in 1958. The Ba'ath Party, a pan-Arab nationalist and socialist movement, rose to power, 
>initially promising unity and progress. However, it increasingly became authoritarian and nationalistic.
>
>* **The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988):** This brutal war, fueled by territorial disputes (especially over the 
>Shatt al-Arab waterway) and ideological differences (Shia Islam vs. Sunni Islam), devastated Iraq and 
>further destabilized the region.
>* **The Gulf War (1991):** A US-led coalition liberated Kuwait after Iraq invaded. The imposition of 
>crippling sanctions on Iraq further weakened the country and fueled resentment.
>* **The US-led Invasion of 2003:** The invasion, justified on the grounds of alleged weapons of mass 
>destruction (which were never found), toppled Saddam Hussein’s regime. However, it unleashed a cascade of 
>unintended consequences, including the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.
>
>**3. "Secrets" Uncovered & Their Impact:**
>
>* **The Drower Sites:** The discovery of numerous drower (manhunter) sites – locations where Assyrian kings 
>had their enemies’ heads displayed – is a stark reminder of the region’s violent history and the brutal 
>nature of ancient empires.
>* **The "Lost" Mesopotamian Cities:** Archaeological discoveries continue to reveal the scale and 
>sophistication of ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, challenging simplistic narratives of the region’s 
>history.
>* **The Alleged WMDs (2003):** The failure to find evidence of WMDs in Iraq undermined the justification for 
>the invasion and fueled accusations of deception.
>* **The Existence of Ancient Trade Networks:** Ongoing archaeological work is revealing the extent of 
>ancient trade networks and the interconnectedness of Mesopotamian civilizations with the wider world.
>
>**4. Current Geopolitics & Crisis Drivers:**
>
>* **The Rise of ISIS:** The power vacuum created by the 2003 invasion and the ongoing instability allowed 
>ISIS to gain control of significant territory in Iraq and Syria.
>* **Shia-Sunni Conflict:** The sectarian divisions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, exacerbated by the 2003 
>invasion and the rise of extremist groups, remain a major source of conflict.
>* **The Kurdish Question:** The Kurds, a stateless ethnic group spread across Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran, 
>have long sought greater autonomy or independence, leading to ongoing tensions with the central governments.
>* **Regional Rivalries:** The region is a battleground for competing interests between Iran, Saudi Arabia, 
>Turkey, and the United States.
>* **The Syrian Civil War:** The ongoing conflict in Syria has had a devastating impact on Iraq, with 
>refugees fleeing the violence and instability.
>
>
>**In conclusion, the persistent instability in Mesopotamia is not a simple accident. It’s the result of 
>centuries of competition for resources, strategic location, and the legacy of artificial borders and 
>geopolitical maneuvering. The region remains a complex and volatile area, deeply scarred by its history and 
>caught in the crosscurrents of global power politics.**
