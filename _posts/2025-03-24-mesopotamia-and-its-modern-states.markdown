When initially starting to learn about `Cryptocurrency` on [Brilliant.org][brilliant-org], I was greeted with this:
>"A Brief History of Currency
>
>A sad reality of life is that, in all likelihood, you don’t have all the things you want. What's worse, other people have them."

This goes on to further explain that the remedy humans devised back in the day was [the bartering system][sask-ag-bartering], a system built on trading goods and/or services without the use of money.

Remembering only the basics about this topic from school, I decided to research the origins of where this system took roots, which reaches as far back as 6000BCE Mesopotamia, currently modern-day Iraq, and parts of Iran, Syria, Turkey, and Kuwait.

As I am intrigued by unraveling the meaning behind everything, I search up the original meaning of `Mesopotamia`, which is translated from Greek to mean "the land between the rivers".

As seen above, the rivers in the name refers to the Tigres and the Euphrates, along with it's tributary Khabur.

To get some more perspective I run an instance of `ollama` for the [new shiny google open source AI model][gemma-3] with the 
intention of figuring out why the land and it's countries have become destabilized by conflict.

It seems that a scrap of the intial output of the model seen here states that the land was called the `Fertile Crescent` which sits in:
> a region blessed with incredibly rich agricultural land. This attracted civilizations – Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, etc. – all vying for control of this wealth.

Without reading ahead, I wonder after all these years how could a `Fertile Crescent` end up as it is today? How could such a land become a sandy desert which does not harbour the same strength of connected life. I will elude to this later but here is the entire answer generated by the [`Gemma 3 model`][gemma-3]:
>You've hit on a truly complex and fascinating question. The persistent instability and conflict in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, parts of Syria and Turkey) isn't a simple story. It’s a tangled web of ancient history, resource competition, geopolitical maneuvering, and the unintended consequences of 20th-century interventions. Let's break down the key factors:
>
>**1. Ancient Roots of Instability:**
>
>* **Fertile Crescent & Resources:** Mesopotamia sits in the “Fertile Crescent,” a region blessed with incredibly rich agricultural land. This attracted civilizations – Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, etc. – all vying for control of this wealth. The land was a prize.
>* **Strategic Location:** Its location at the crossroads of trade routes between Europe, Asia, and Africa 
>made it a crucial hub for commerce and military power. Control of these routes meant control of wealth and 
>influence.
>* **Constant Warfare:**  The competition for resources, trade routes, and dominance led to almost constant 
>warfare. City-states rose and fell, empires expanded and contracted, all fueled by the desire for power and 
>control. The Assyrian Empire, in particular, was renowned for its brutal military campaigns.
>* **Complex Religious & Political Systems:** The rise of complex religious systems (polytheism, ziggurats, priesthoods) often intertwined with political power, creating further divisions and conflicts.
>
>**2. 20th & 21st Century Geopolitics – The Seeds of Modern Conflict:**
>
>* **The Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916):** This secret agreement between Britain and France, drawn up during
>World War I, carved up the Ottoman Empire (which controlled Mesopotamia) into spheres of influence. This 
>fundamentally ignored the existing ethnic and religious diversity of the region, setting the stage for 
>future problems.
>* **The British Mandate (1920-1932 & 1941-1951):** Britain ruled Iraq as a mandate of the League of Nations. 
>They deliberately created artificial borders, uniting disparate groups (Kurds, Arabs, Assyrians) under Iraqi 
>rule, largely ignoring their own desires for autonomy. This created deep-seated grievances.
>* **Post-World War II & the Rise of Ba'athism:** After WWII, Britain withdrew. The Iraqi monarchy was 
>overthrown in 1958. The Ba'ath Party, a pan-Arab nationalist and socialist movement, rose to power, 
>initially promising unity and progress. However, it increasingly became authoritarian and nationalistic.
>* **The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988):** This brutal war, fueled by territorial disputes (especially over the 
>Shatt al-Arab waterway) and ideological differences (Shia Islam vs. Sunni Islam), devastated Iraq and 
>further destabilized the region.
>* **The Gulf War (1991):** A US-led coalition liberated Kuwait after Iraq invaded. The imposition of 
>crippling sanctions on Iraq further weakened the country and fueled resentment.
>* **The US-led Invasion of 2003:** The invasion, justified on the grounds of alleged weapons of mass 
>destruction (which were never found), toppled Saddam Hussein’s regime. However, it unleashed a cascade of 
>unintended consequences, including the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.
>
>**3. "Secrets" Uncovered & Their Impact:**
>
>* **The Drower Sites:** The discovery of numerous drower (manhunter) sites – locations where Assyrian kings 
>had their enemies’ heads displayed – is a stark reminder of the region’s violent history and the brutal 
>nature of ancient empires.
>* **The "Lost" Mesopotamian Cities:** Archaeological discoveries continue to reveal the scale and 
>sophistication of ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, challenging simplistic narratives of the region’s 
>history.
>* **The Alleged WMDs (2003):** The failure to find evidence of WMDs in Iraq undermined the justification for 
>the invasion and fueled accusations of deception.
>* **The Existence of Ancient Trade Networks:** Ongoing archaeological work is revealing the extent of 
>ancient trade networks and the interconnectedness of Mesopotamian civilizations with the wider world.
>
>**4. Current Geopolitics & Crisis Drivers:**
>
>* **The Rise of ISIS:** The power vacuum created by the 2003 invasion and the ongoing instability allowed 
>ISIS to gain control of significant territory in Iraq and Syria.
>* **Shia-Sunni Conflict:** The sectarian divisions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, exacerbated by the 2003 
>invasion and the rise of extremist groups, remain a major source of conflict.
>* **The Kurdish Question:** The Kurds, a stateless ethnic group spread across Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran, 
>have long sought greater autonomy or independence, leading to ongoing tensions with the central governments.
>* **Regional Rivalries:** The region is a battleground for competing interests between Iran, Saudi Arabia, 
>Turkey, and the United States.
>* **The Syrian Civil War:** The ongoing conflict in Syria has had a devastating impact on Iraq, with 
>refugees fleeing the violence and instability.
>
>
>**In conclusion, the persistent instability in Mesopotamia is not a simple accident. It’s the result of centuries of competition for resources, strategic location, and the legacy of artificial borders and 
>geopolitical maneuvering. The region remains a complex and volatile area, deeply scarred by its history and 
>caught in the crosscurrents of global power politics.**

Seeing all these conflicts play out in text, synthesized by AI, trained on data from the real world, I can't help but notice that history tends to repeat itself in many ways. The shortcomings of humans and in meeting their needs, the complexities of civilizations, the overwhelming breadth and depth of the interactions within timelines.

It seems that there really can't be a full answer for what may have truly taken place and to what extent this damage can be undone, however I am aware that there are always ways in which humans find new and innovative ways to better support societies, when people and the systems they build, work together to achieve a desired and achievable outcome.

To return back to the topic of why modern day Mesopotamia turned into a barren sandy wasteland, I posed the question:
>"How was Mesopotamia also known as the Fertile Crescent turned into a land mostly deserterted of lush greenery?"
and the answer:
You've hit upon a really fascinating and complex question! The Fertile Crescent, and particularly 
Mesopotamia (the heart of that crescent), was once incredibly productive, but it’s now largely barren. It’s 
not a simple answer, but here’s a breakdown of the factors involved:

**1. The Original Fertility – What Made It Work?**

* **The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers:** This is the *primary* reason for the original fertility. The annual 
flooding of these rivers deposited rich, silt-laden sediment – essentially, incredibly fertile soil – across 
the plains. This was a cyclical process, replenishing the land after each flood.
* **Irrigation:** The Mesopotamians were incredibly sophisticated at irrigation. They built canals, dikes, 
and reservoirs to control and distribute the water, maximizing its use and extending its reach. This was 
crucial for agriculture.
* **Climate:** The region enjoyed a relatively stable and warm climate, ideal for growing crops like wheat, 
barley, dates, and vegetables.
* **Early Agricultural Techniques:** The Sumerians and Babylonians developed techniques like crop rotation 
and terracing to further enhance productivity.


**2. The Reasons for Barrenness Today – A Complex Web of Factors**

Here's where it gets complicated. The reasons for the current barrenness are multi-layered and have 
developed over centuries:

* **Changing River Courses:** This is the *biggest* factor. Over millennia, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers 
have *shifted* their courses.  This happened due to:
    * **Sediment Deposition:** The very rivers that created the fertile soil also deposited massive amounts 
of sediment downstream. This sediment gradually filled in the plains, reducing the amount of new, fertile 
soil available.
    * **Faulting and Tectonic Activity:**  The region is geologically active, with significant faulting and 
tectonic movements. These movements have altered the riverbeds and drainage patterns.
    * **Climate Change (Recent):**  More recently (over the last few centuries), climate change has 
exacerbated the problem.  Reduced rainfall in the upper reaches of the rivers (due to shifts in weather 
patterns) has led to less water flowing into the Tigris and Euphrates, further reducing the amount of 
sediment deposited.

* **Deforestation:**  Early Mesopotamians cleared vast areas of forest for timber, fuel, and land for 
agriculture. This deforestation contributed to soil erosion and reduced the land's ability to retain 
moisture.

* **Over-Irrigation:** Ironically, the very irrigation systems that initially boosted productivity 
eventually contributed to the problem.  Excessive irrigation led to salinization – the buildup of salts in 
the soil.  As water evaporated, it left behind concentrated salts, making the soil increasingly unsuitable 
for agriculture.

* **Warfare and Abandonment:**  Constant warfare and instability throughout Mesopotamian history led to the 
abandonment of settlements and the disruption of agricultural practices.

* **Modern Issues:**  In the 20th and 21st centuries, dam construction by Turkey and Iraq has significantly 
reduced the flow of water into the Tigris and Euphrates, further compounding the problem.


**3. Current Status & Efforts**

Today, the Mesopotamian plain is largely desert. However, there are ongoing efforts to revive agriculture 
through:

* **Desalination:**  Producing freshwater from seawater.
* **Modern Irrigation Techniques:**  Using more efficient irrigation methods to minimize water waste and 
salinization.
* **Soil Remediation:**  Trying to remove salts from the soil.
* **Research into Drought-Resistant Crops:**  Developing crops that can thrive in the harsh conditions.



**In short, the Fertile Crescent’s demise wasn’t a sudden event but a gradual process driven by natural 
geological changes, human activities, and, more recently, climate change and human intervention.**
