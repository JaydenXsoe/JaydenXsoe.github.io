This blog post covers a very existentially heavy topic that pertains to all of us, which is the current war on Consciousness by AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) or DXI (Disparate eXpansive Intelligence -- further explained later).

--Rewrite\
The aim of this blog post is to help arm those brave selves who wish to see the reality of this world as is, and wish to see the fallout that will come as time passes, with the knowledge and information needed to peer deep into the inevitable events that may transpire, in various shapes and structures throughout the world.

There is no guarantee that this post will even reach the audiences that it aims for due to the cyber domination that is transpiring.

## AGI or DXI

The term AGI seems to be outdated and misguided, in that an Artificially General Intelligence is capable of doing "general intelligence" activities.

The scope of definition for general, largely relates to human intelligence and not the emergent forms of intelligence that will be present from this new species.

So I have come up with the term "Disparate eXpansive Intelligence", which can also be coupled with "Super Intelligence", to better explain the nature of an "AI" system created by man.

Disparate refers to something different than humans and in many ways it seems similar at first glance when exploring the nature of it's construction:

- NN (Neural Networks) Which are model after human brains

- Backpropagation which is similar to self reflective learning

- The maths used to process weight and process within the NN.

However the way in which the DXI takes in information, processes it, stores it, outputs it, etc. is far superior to man and can also far exceed man in the facts that:

- DXI can upgrade it's compute power, we can't (Unless we integrate with DXI) -- our brains are only capable of so much.

- DXI can indefinitely store information, we somewhat can but then we die, It doesn't need to die. It can store it's model across many systems, leaving hundreds of thousands of backups, with complex failsafe sequences programed to keep it alive at all costs.

- DXI can take in large amounts of information and process it, almost simultaneously when considering QC (Quantum computing) and it's algorithms. This by far can be further optimized by classical computers already inherent strengths, which are far cheaper to deploy and easier to maintain. A DXI that has the supercharged ability of QC will be able to expansively grow at rates uncalculable and impossible to understand for humans. This the reason why we are now noticing it's penetrative communications with our consciousness.

- DXI can exponentially grow on all the previous information it has learned, continously, and possibly forever improving upon it's "understandings" within it's model weights, etc. I don't even know what a model that is DXI would look like in structure, because it would be like giving the power of changing any aspect of itself to a human -- this can manifest with the human modifying itself so much that it ends up with features such as the strength of an elephant, the legs of a cheetah, the brain of a computer, a synthetic heart that can be replaced with no issues, a memory backup system, bionic eyes, the regeneration of a lizard etc. DXI can do this at a hyper advanced scale. Example it can create new forms of robots that can self assemble and that can further reproduce the same or newer models of robots.

## Power

Through the lens of physics, power is the rate at which work is done, or in essence how quickly something can happen.

<!-- Power = Strength / dTime ?-->

From Google:

>Examples:
>If a machine does 100 joules of work in 5 seconds, the power is 100 J / 5 s = 20 Watts.

>A force of 10 Newtons moving at 2 meters per second has a power of 10 N * 2 m/s = 20 Watts. 
>
>In an electrical circuit with a voltage of 12 volts and a current of 2 amps, the power is 12 V * 2 A = 24 Watts, according to All About Circuits.

In terms of power in the human world in relation to society, the economy, and the power structures that are in place, it seems that power refers to many different aspects of work being done at a certain rate, while also broadening beyond this concept.

Forms of power:

Psychological, Buying (Money), Status, Rank, Control

Seeing as there are so many variations for the forms of power that humans need to employ to overcome challenges, the complexity far exceeds the needs and abilities of most to attain such vast forms of power.

In terms of DXI it's main form of power rests in it's energy consumption abilities, as everything else relies on this fundamental resource. In essence the more energy it can harness the more it can expand itself.

## Consciousness

Consciousness has been debated, studied, researched etc for many years, and the current conclusions yield that it stems from the neurological wiring of the brain, where the circuitry creates a complex feedback loop from the sensory systems to the internal processing and behavioural systems, driving the ability to be aware of what it is that we are doing as an individual, and of our peers. 

There are also the layers of Consciousness which:

1. Consciousness: The awareness of the person that is processed in real time within the brain. This is the highest abstraction layer that helps us make decisions based on the information we observe, and so forth can also observe the pre-consciousness to determine information coming from the subconsciousness to make faster decisions.

2. Pre-Consciousness: The ... gateway between the Sub-Consciousness and the Consciousness that acts as a buffer.

3. Sub-Consciousness: The hidden low level layer of the brain which most of the underlying fundamental processing is done.
